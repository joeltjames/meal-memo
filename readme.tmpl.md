# meal-memo
[![Build Status](https://drone.joeltjames.com/api/badges/joeltjames/meal-memo/status.svg?ref=refs/heads/alpha)](https://drone.joeltjames.com/joeltjames/meal-memo)

A Typescript/Angular/Node/Express application written to manage recipes and allow for quick and easy meal planning.

Intended to be self-hosted.

Will eventually be Dockerized.

Currently, there is no database backing this application, but the intention is for it to be supported by PostgresSQL. I also intend to allow support for MySQL and sqlite.
